sandbox for creating/evolving cellular automata

The goal of this project is to make a library for creating cellular automata (cells) and their environments. I hope to
evolve the cells using a genetic algorithm until they do something cool.

I would also like to implement a cell with a neural network and allow for different implementations of cells to compete.

A simple animation of random-behavior cells can be seen in 'randomCells.py'.
